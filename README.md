## Itinerary

### Saturday

**14:00** - Meet at the Didsbury pub - M20 2SG

**15:40** - Priority boarders enter Parsonage Trust (next to the pub) for ceremony

**15:50** - Everyone else comes into Parsonage Trust - only 60 people will fit in for the ceremony so some people may have to wait in the gardens (or pub)

**16:00** - Ceremony starts

**16:30** - Champagne and sandwiches

**17:30** - Minibuses to our house for the afterparty! (Food and booze provided)

### Sunday

Weather permitting, we plan to setup a gazebo in Longford park (next to our house) at about midday to hang out, play disc golf etc. There's a cafe for brunch/lunch/ice creams. If it rains check here for update.

We will be having a few drinks somewhere Sunday evening too - no need to rush off now there's a bank holiday on the Monday!

## Notes

* No wedding presents
* Eat lunch before coming to the pub - we will be providing snacks and evening meal
* Minibuses provided from Didsbury to our house, we recommend not driving
* Don't try and park on our road on the Saturday, the road is closed for a street party.
